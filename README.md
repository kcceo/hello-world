# hello-world
Just another repository

I am a grateful, energetic, high-performing and inclusive technology and business leader who embraces challenges with fun, passionate about helping people and delivering products and well-crafted strategies for growth-focused companies. 

Founder Gym alumna and quiet, eager champion of diversity, equity and inclusion transformation.

My mastery includes building products and transforming businesses through years of leadership experience with an ability to sustain trusted relationships that allow me and my incredible teams to deliver outcomes that support low-risk, high-reward decisions. 

I automate outdated methods where needed, honoring the past, staying practical in the present, and creating the future.

The first end to end software product I led and owned was a greenfield V1, built from scratch with a small, scrappy, super talented team and a user base of 60,000. 
It was designed, developed, and launched in 2009, fully adopted, and still in use 10 years later. 
Parts of the design shipped in another enterprise product (Microsoft Dynamics) years later.
